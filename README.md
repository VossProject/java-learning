# Java Learning Journey

My structured path through Java, from fundamentals to advanced topics.

## Progress

| Phase | Topic | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 01 | Fundamentals | In Progress |
| 02 | Object-Oriented Programming | Not Started |
| 03 | Data Structures | Not Started |
| 04 | Algorithms | Not Started |
| 05 | Advanced Java | Not Started |

## Structure

```
01-fundamentals/       Variables, operators, control flow, arrays
02-oop/                Classes, inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation
03-data-structures/    Lists, maps, sets, stacks & queues
04-algorithms/         Sorting, searching, recursion
05-advanced/           Exceptions, file I/O, generics, lambdas
projects/              Larger projects that combine multiple topics
```

## How I Work

- Each topic has its own branch during development
- Completed work is merged to `main`
- Commit messages follow conventional format

## Tools

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **OS:** macOS
